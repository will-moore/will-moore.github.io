title: My 2016
---

It's a little late for the new year, but I thought I'd try and summarise
my 2016.

I was inspired by [John Resig's blog post](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/)
to try and contribute to my side project [OMERO.figure](http://figure.openmicroscopy.org/) every day. For a while I had been sporadically working on it and not making
as much progress as I'd wanted.

Starting on the 1st of January 2015, I began daily contributions to OMERO.figure that lasted until
after the [1.1.0 release](http://figure.openmicroscopy.org/2015/04/20/release-1.1.0.html)
in April. After a summer break, I started another github streak until after the next
[major release](http://figure.openmicroscopy.org/2015/11/24/release-1.2.0.html) in
November.


In July, OMERO.figure was adopted by the OME project. So it's less of a side project
now.

Having added a bunch of key functionality in 2015, I think I will probably focus a
little less on OMERO.figure in 2016.
