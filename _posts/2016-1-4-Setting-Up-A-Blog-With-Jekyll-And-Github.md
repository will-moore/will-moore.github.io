title: Setting Up A Blog With Jekyll And Github
---

Having recently read a bunch of end-of-year blog posts
(linked from [Jeremy Keith's](https://medium.com/@adactio/year-8217-s-end-285515cc463d)),
I decided it's about time I started a blog of some sort.

Having already enjoyed using Jekyll to build a static web site and blog for
[OMERO.figure](http://figure.openmicroscopy.org/)
I opted to go for the same approach for this site, including hosting on github.
I used a nice blog post on [jekyll with github pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
as a guide to setting up.

All I have to do now is think of something to blog about!
