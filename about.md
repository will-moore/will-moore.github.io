I am a web developer living near Dundee in Scotland.

Originally a biologist, I now work on the web client of the
[OMERO project](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero).

I created [OMERO.figure](http://figure.openmicroscopy.org/), a web app for
creating figures from your microscope images.

### Background

I came to Dundee to do a Phd in cell biology with Paul Clarke and then joined
the lab of [Jason Swedlow](http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/people/jason-swedlow) as
a post-doc. The lab does a lot of cell biology and microscopy and Jason's group
also develops software to handle microscopy data: [The OME project](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site).

The OME developers based in Dundee work on [OMERO](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero), a client-server platform for managing microscopy data.


After 3 years in the lab, I decided that I wanted to be a developer.
I left to do an MSc in Applied Computing at Dundee Uni.
This included a 6-month project back in the Swedlow lab, working on a Java-based lab notebook that became [OMERO.editor](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero422/getting-started/tutorial/omero.editor).

I then returned to Jason's group as a full-time developer, initially continuing
to work on OMERO.editor, then switching to Python and the OMERO.web client.
